# chemshell-QMMM-protein-setup

MM and QM/MM setup for a metalloprotein using GROMACS,  Chemshell and ORCA
(Using the CHARMM forcefield (both in GROMACS and with Chemshell) and the ORCA code as QM code for Chemshell.)

Scripts to perform GROMACS MM setup and MM simulations for a metalloprotein and subsequent Chemshell QM/MM calculations as used in our nitrogenase QM/MM study:
