# chemshell-QMMM-protein-setup

MM and QM/MM setup for a metalloprotein using GROMACS,  Chemshell and ORCA
(Using the CHARMM forcefield (both in GROMACS and with Chemshell) and the ORCA code as QM code for Chemshell.)

This page contains technical details regarding the GROMACS MM setup and QM/MM setup in Chemshell as performed in our QM/MM study on nitrogenase:
QM/MM Study of the Nitrogenase MoFe Protein Resting State: Broken-Symmetry States, Protonation States, and QM Region Convergence in the FeMoco Active Site

Scripts to perform GROMACS MM setup and MM simulations for a metalloprotein and subsequent Chemshell QM/MM calculations are described on this page and available on a Github page here.
The CHARMM36 forcefield is used throughout. Topology and parameter files were downloaded from Alexander McKerell's website both in GROMACS and CHARMM formats and modified.
